	abstract = {Pharmacodynamic modeling is based on a quantitative integration of pharmacokinetics, pharmacological systems, and (patho-) physiological processes for understanding the intensity and time-course of drug effects on the body. Application of such models to the analysis of meaningful experimental data allows for the quantification and prediction of drug–system interactions for both therapeutic and adverse drug responses. In this chapter, commonly used mechanistic pharmacodynamic models are presented with respect to their important features, operable equations, and signature profiles. In addition, literature examples showcasing the utility of these models to adverse drug events are highlighted. Common model types that are covered include simple direct effects, biophase distribution, indirect effects, signal transduction, and irreversible effects.},

	abstract = {On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization ({WHO}) classiﬁed the Coronavirus Disease 2019 ({COVID}-19) as a global pandemic, which tested healthcare systems, administrations, and treatment ingenuity across the world. {COVID}-19 is caused by the novel beta coronavirus Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 ({SARS}-{CoV}-2). Since the inception of the pandemic, treatment options have been either limited or ineffective. Remdesivir, a drug originally designed to be used for Ebola virus, has antiviral activity against {SARS}-{CoV}-2 and has been included in the {COVID}-19 treatment regimens. Remdesivir is an adenosine nucleotide analog prodrug that is metabolically activated to a nucleoside triphosphate metabolite ({GS}-443902). The active nucleoside triphosphate metabolite is incorporated into the {SARS}-{CoV}-2 {RNA} viral chains, preventing its replication. The lack of reported drug development and characterization studies with remdesivir in public domain has created a void where information on the absorption, distribution, metabolism, elimination ({ADME}) properties, pharmacokinetics ({PK}), or drug-drug interaction ({DDI}) is limited. By understanding these properties, clinicians can prevent subtherapeutic and supratherapeutic levels of remdesivir and thus avoid further complications in {COVID}-19 patients. Remdesivir is metabolized by both cytochrome P450 ({CYP}) and non-{CYP} enzymes such as carboxylesterases. In this narrative review, we have evaluated the currently available {ADME}, {PK}, and {DDI} information about remdesivir and have discussed the potential of {DDIs} between remdesivir and different {COVID}-19 drug regimens and agents used for comorbidities. Considering the nascent status of remdesivir in the therapeutic domain, extensive future work is needed to formulate safer {COVID}-19 treatment guidelines involving this medication.},

Ivermectin has been recommended widely as a treatment of {COVID}-­19, but whether it has clinically significant antiviral activity in vivo is uncertain. Methods: In a multicentre open label, randomized, controlled adaptive platform trial, adult patients with early symptomatic {COVID}-1­ 9 were randomized to one of six treatment arms including high-­ dose oral ivermectin (600 µg/kg daily for 7 days), the monoclonal antibodies casirivimab and imdevimab (600 mg/600 mg), and no study drug. The primary outcome was the comparison of viral clearance rates in the modified intention-t­o-­treat population. This was derived from daily log10 viral densities in standardized duplicate oropharyngeal swab eluates. This ongoing trial is registered at https://clinicaltrials.gov/ ({NCT}05041907).},

	abstract = {A consensus methodology for the pharmacometric assessment of candidate {SARS}-{CoV}-2 antiviral drugs would be useful for comparing trial results and improving trial design. The time to viral clearance, assessed by serial {qPCR} of nasopharyngeal swab samples, has been the most widely reported measure of virological response in clinical trials, but it has not been compared formally with other metrics, notably model-based estimates of the rate of viral clearance. We analyzed prospectively gathered viral clearance proﬁles from 280 infection episodes in vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals. We ﬁtted different phenomenological pharmacodynamic models (single exponential decay, bi-exponential, penalized splines) and found that the clearance rate, estimated from a mixed effects single exponential decay model, is a robust pharmacodynamic summary of viral clearance. The rate of viral clearance, estimated from viral densities during the ﬁrst week following peak viral load, provides increased statistical power (reduced type 2 error) compared with time to clearance. Antiviral effects approximately equivalent to those with currently used and recommended {SARS}-{CoV}-2 antiviral treatments, notably nirmatrelvir and molnupiravir, can be detected from randomized trials with sample sizes of only 35 to 65 patients per arm. We recommend that pharmacometric antiviral assessments should be conducted in early {COVID}-19 illness with serial {qPCR} samples taken over 1 week.},
